      <h2>Standard Approval Roadmap (Canada)</h2>
      <ol class="steps">
        <li><strong>Proof of Identity:</strong> Government-issued photo ID; Indigenous status card if claiming tax exemption.</li>
        <li><strong>Proof of Income:</strong> 2+ years of one or more: CRA NOAs; T1 General returns; bank statements; employer letter; buyer/distributor letters.</li>
        <li><strong>Proof of Residence:</strong> Utility bill, bank statement, or Band office letter.</li>
        <li><strong>Credit Check:</strong> After we forward your application, <strong>the partner dealership</strong> will pull your credit report (Equifax or TransUnion Canada).</li>
        <li><strong>Down Payment (if required):</strong> Some lenders require a small down payment for seasonal or non-salary income.</li>
        <li><strong>Apply:</strong> When your documents are ready, return to the home page and submit the form.</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Important:</strong> If income isn‚Äôt documented (tax returns, bank deposits, official letters), approval chances are very low ‚Äî even with a down payment. On-reserve, tax-exempt income must be documented.
